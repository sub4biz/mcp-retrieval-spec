# mcp-retrieval-spec

The jMRI (jMunch Retrieval Interface) specification — an open interface standard for token-efficient context retrieval in MCP servers.

---

## What Is jMRI?

Agents that read whole files to answer specific questions waste 99% of their token budget. jMRI is a minimal interface for MCP servers that do retrieval right: index once, search by intent, retrieve exactly what you need.

Four operations. One response envelope. Two compliance levels.

**The problem in numbers:** A typical FastAPI codebase costs ~42,000 tokens to read naively. jMRI retrieval of the same answer costs ~480 tokens. At $3/1M tokens, that's $0.126 vs. $0.0014 per query. Across millions of queries, the savings are material.

The jMunch tools have saved billions of tokens across user sessions. This spec is the formal definition of what they do.

---

## How It Works

```
Agent
  │
  ├─ discover()    → What knowledge sources are available?
  ├─ search(query) → Which symbols/sections are relevant? (IDs + summaries only)
  ├─ retrieve(id)  → Give me the exact source for this ID.
  └─ metadata(id?) → What would naive reading have cost?
```

Every response includes a `_meta` block with `tokens_saved` and `total_tokens_saved`. Agents can see exactly what they're saving on every call.

## Spec

→ [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md)

The full jMRI v1.0 specification. Apache 2.0. Implement it however you want.

---

## Reference Implementations

The spec is open. The best implementations are commercial.

| Implementation | Domain | Stars | Install |
|----------------|--------|-------|---------|
| [jCodeMunch](https://github.com/jgravelle/jcodemunch-mcp) | Code (70+ languages) | 1,500+ | `uvx jcodemunch-mcp` |
| [jDocMunch](https://github.com/jgravelle/jdocmunch-mcp) | Docs (MD, RST, HTML, notebooks) | 135+ | `uvx jdocmunch-mcp` |
| [jDataMunch](https://github.com/jgravelle/jdatamunch-mcp) | Tabular data (CSV, Excel, Parquet, JSONL) | new | `uvx jdatamunch-mcp` |

Both implement jMRI-Full. Licenses available at https://j.gravelle.us/jCodeMunch/

## Quick Start

### Using the Python SDK

```python
from sdk.python.mri_client import MRIClient

client = MRIClient()  # connects to local jcodemunch-mcp

# List available repos
sources = client.discover()

# Search
results = client.search("database session dependency", repo="fastapi/fastapi")
for r in results:
    print(r["id"], r["summary"])

# Retrieve
symbol = client.retrieve(results[0]["id"], repo="fastapi/fastapi")
print(symbol["source"])
print(f"Tokens saved: {symbol['_meta']['tokens_saved']:,}")
```

### Claude Code Integration

Add to your `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jcodemunch-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jcodemunch-mcp"]
    },
    "jdocmunch-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jdocmunch-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [examples/claude-code/](./examples/claude-code/) for full setup.

### Cursor Integration

## Licensing

| Component | License |
|-----------|---------|
| SPEC.md | Apache 2.0 — implement freely |
| SDK clients | Apache 2.0 — use freely |
| Reference server | Requires jMunch license for commercial use |
| Conformance suite | Apache 2.0 |
| Benchmark suite | Apache 2.0 |

This is the [Stripe model](https://stripe.com/docs/api): the API spec is open and well-documented; the best implementation is commercial.

## Conformance

→ [jmri/conformance/](./jmri/conformance/README.md)

Any MCP retrieval server claiming jMRI compliance can run the bundled conformance suite to validate against the spec. Two tiers (`Core` MUST / `Full` SHOULD), 14 named cases pinned to specific `SPEC.md` invariants. Markdown or JSON output for CI / dashboards.

```bash
pip install jmri-sdk
python -m jmri.conformance --repo owner/repo --server-cmd "your-jmri-server"
```

Verdict: `jMRI-Full compliant` / `jMRI-Core compliant` / `NOT compliant — N MUST failure(s)`. Exit code 0 on Core-compliant runs (with or without Full gaps), 1 otherwise.

**Self-reporting only.** Maintainers run the suite against their own servers and publish the report. We don't run conformance against competitors — that's adversarial and not the shape we want a standards-bearer to take. Third parties claiming compliance: run, save, link.

## Citation

If you reference jMRI in research or as the substrate for a benchmark, please cite the spec — not a vendor methodology paper. The canonical citation is the Zenodo deposit:

> Gravelle, J. (2026). *jMRI: jMunch Retrieval Interface Specification* (v1.1.1) [Software]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20102349

`CITATION.cff` in the repo root has the structured form for citation managers.

## Benchmark

→ [benchmark/](./benchmark/)

Clone and run in under 5 minutes. Compares Naive, Chunk RAG, and jMRI on FastAPI and Flask. Results are honest: if RAG beats jMRI on a metric, it's reported.

Real numbers on FastAPI (950K naive tokens):

| Method | Avg Tokens | Cost/Query | Precision |
|--------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Naive (read all files) | 949,904 | $2.85 | 100% |
| Chunk RAG | 330,372 | $0.99 | 74% |
| **jMRI** | **480** | **$0.0014** | **96%** |

**1,979x fewer tokens than naive. Higher precision than RAG.**

## Contributing

The spec is intentionally minimal. PRs that extend the core interface require strong justification. PRs that improve examples, fix errors, or add language-specific SDK clients are welcome.
